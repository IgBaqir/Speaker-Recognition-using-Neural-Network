# Speaker Recognition Model

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based speaker recognition system that utilizes deep learning to accurately identify and authenticate individuals based on their voice characteristics. This project combines CNN and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures to leverage temporal and spatial features for robust speaker recognition.

## Overview

This project implements a speaker recognition system designed to analyze and authenticate unique voice features. Our model extracts key characteristics from voice samples, creating a unique fingerprint for each speaker, enabling high accuracy in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid CNN-RNN Architecture**: Combines the strengths of CNNs for feature extraction and RNNs for handling temporal voice data.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Built to support multiple speakers and adaptable for different use cases.
- **Real-Time Capabilities**: Efficient enough for deployment in real-time applications.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the training and test datasets, formatted as per the model’s input requirements.
- **models/**: Stores the trained models and checkpoints for reproducibility.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for model training, evaluation, and experimentation.
- **src/**: Core code for model architecture, preprocessing, and training pipelines.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and usage guide.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/speaker-recognition.git
   cd speaker-recognition
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare the dataset:
   Place your training and testing audio files in the `data/` directory, following the structure outlined in [Data Preparation](#data-preparation).

## Data Preparation

To ensure compatibility with the model, audio files should be:

- **Format**: `.wav`
- **Sampling Rate**: 16 kHz
- **Duration**: Minimum 3 seconds per sample

Use the preprocessing scripts in `src/preprocess.py` to standardize your data.

## Training the Model

Train the model using the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

Configurations (e.g., batch size, learning rate, epochs) can be customized in the `configs/train_config.yaml` file.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model’s performance on the test set, run:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model-path models/best_model.pth
```

The evaluation script provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model’s effectiveness in speaker recognition.


## Future Work

Potential improvements and next steps:

1. **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporating a larger, more diverse dataset.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning for enhanced accuracy.
3. **Real-Time Deployment**: Integrating with edge devices for real-time processing.
